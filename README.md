## РџЎ№ИЈ Configuration & Setup


### ­ЪЊІ Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- MySQL (running locally or remotely)
- Anthropic Claude Desktop app (or Cursor)
- UV (Python package manager), install with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`

### Steps

1. **Clone this repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ashutosh-rajput/mysql-mcp.git
   cd mysql-mcp
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Fill the .env**
    ```
    MYSQL_HOST=localhost
    MYSQL_PORT=3306
    MYSQL_USER=root
    MYSQL_PASSWORD=yourpassword
    MYSQL_DATABASE=yourdatabase
   ```


3. **Connect to the MCP server**

   Copy the below json with the appropriate {{PATH}} values:

   ```json
       {
      "mcpServers": {
        "Mysql": {
          "command": "[path to uv]/uv",
          "args": [
            "run",
            "--with", "fastmcp",
            "--with", "mysql-connector-python",
            "--with", "python-dotenv",
            "fastmcp",
            "run",
            "[path to your main.py]/main.py"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
   ```

   For **Claude**, save this as `claude_desktop_config.json` in your Claude Desktop configuration directory at:

   ```
   ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

   For **Cursor**, save this as `mcp.json` in your Cursor configuration directory at:

   ```
   ~/.cursor/mcp.json
   ```

4. **Restart Claude Desktop / Cursor**

   Open Claude Desktop and you should now see WhatsApp as an available integration.

   Or restart Cursor.
